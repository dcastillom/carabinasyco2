			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No matter how big (or small) your online store, you’re always looking to convert visitors. Your conversion rate is essentially the life line of your online business. Ecommerce conversions cover a wide range of activities from purchasing products to subscribing to newsletters. Each of these actions show that visitors are not just interested but want to engage with you.</p>
<p>Since your success as an ecommerce merchant depends on conversion, I’m helping you by sharing the <strong>5 secrets for better ecommerce conversions.</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16304" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/EN_5-Secrets-for-better-ecommerce-conversions.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="341" /></p>
<p><span id="more-16288"></span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #339966">1. Mobile Friendly</span></h4>
<p>Google and Nielsen conducted a study last year to learn more about<a href="http://ssl.gstatic.com/think/docs/mobile-path-to-purchase-5-key-findings_research-studies.pdf" target="_blank"> shoppers and their use of mobile</a>. They found that 93% of people who used mobile to research a product go on to make a purchase. Yes, 93%! To convert these mobile shoppers, your store has to be easily accessible on mobile devices. Every mobile friendly site should:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">•  Have big buttons for easy use<br />
•  Fit into a smartphone-sized screen<br />
•  Load quickly with mobile internet speeds</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16308" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/IMG-mobile-complete-edit.png" alt="" width="442" height="332" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #339966">2. Stunning Images</span></h4>
<p>They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Make sure yours say, “Shop!” We understand that not all online merchants are photographers by trade. So we’ve come up with simple ways to improve product images:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">•  Use the <strong>right image quality</strong> – they should not be pixelated nor take too long to load<br />
•  Allow customers to<strong> zoom in</strong> to get a better view or to examine a particular detail.<br />
•  Have <strong>consistent backgrounds</strong> &#8211; Looking for a budget-friendly way? Remove the background.<br />
•  Learn even more in our article on how to <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/improve-product-photos-online-store-the-5-mistakes-you-dont-want-commit/" target="_blank"><strong>Improve Product Photos for your Online Store.</strong></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16314" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/IMG-bkg-color-1.png" alt="" width="534" height="201" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center">_____________________________</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16315" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/IMG-bkg-color-2.png" alt="" width="534" height="192" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #339966">3. Powerful Searchability</span></h4>
<p>Help customers find exactly what they want … or another site will. Having a <strong>search bar</strong> is a great start but is only helpful if customers know exact names of your product. PrestaShop makes it easy for customers to find what they’re looking for with both front and back office tools.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">•  In the front office, you can allow customers to<strong> filter by product attributes</strong> such as color, price, or size to help narrow down your product catalog.<br />
•  From the back office, you can <strong>refine common search terms</strong> by directing them to words you use. For example, when a customer searches “XS” you can direct them to the results page for “extra small”.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16307" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/IMG-filter-b.png" alt="" width="286" height="357" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #339966">4. Effortless Shopping</span></h4>
<p>Make shopping on your site effortless by offering helpful tools throughout your site for a better shopping experience.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">•  Allow <strong>side by side product comparisons</strong> &#8211; Beyond that, PrestaShop creates unique links for product comparison so that your customers can share it with friends to get their input or bookmark it to view it later.<br />
•  <strong>Offering complementary products</strong>, commonly known as cross selling. If you’re selling wine, ask if they want glasses for that type of wine. Or if a customer adds an MP3 player to their cart, suggest that they add the matching case or headphones to their order. People forget things all the time, this is a nice way to help them complete their purchases and increase your average cart value!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16309" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/IMG-product-comparison.png" alt="" width="596" height="391" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #339966">5. Incentivize</span></h4>
<p>Everyone likes to feel like they’re getting a good deal. Attract customers who are on the fence with enticing incentives by:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">•  <strong>Offering</strong>— The<a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/how-to-increase-ecommerce-cart-value/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=marketplace+fairness+act" target="_blank"> types of ecommerce incentives</a> you offer depends on the types of conversions you’re trying to achieve. Get customers to subscribe to your newsletter by offering free shipping with their first order. Convince visitors to share your site with friends by giving rewards for each additional person they recruit with the link. Finally, get customers to shop by offering them a discount for purchases.<br />
•  <strong>Promoting</strong> — After all, if no one knows about the promo, does it really exist? With all types of banners built into PrestaShop 1.6, there are numerous places to highlight your promotions. Try placing it on the banner at the top of the page, within the rich navigation, or even on the homepage slider.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16310" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/IMG-promo-edit.png" alt="" width="523" height="357" /></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The release of PrestaShop 1.6 is just around the corner! We want to make sure that you’re prepared to upgrade and start taking advantage of all the brilliant new features of this amazing new version.</p>
<p>Our developers have addressed your <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/answers-to-your-questions-about-prestashop-1-6/" target="_blank">questions concerning 1.6</a>. and now we’re sharing The Official Checklist so that you can ensure a smooth transition to PrestaShop 1.6.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16181" title="Are you ready for PrestaShop 1.6 the official checklist" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/Are-you-ready-for-PrestaShop-1.6-the-official-checklist.jpg" alt="" width="595" height="289" /><br />
<span id="more-16180"></span><br />
<img style="border: 0pt none; float: left; padding-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/Checkmark.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #05a6bc;">Set up a testing environment for your online store</span></h4>
<p>Before anything, it’s crucial to set up a test server for your PrestaShop store. When setting up a testing environment for your shop, you’re essentially duplicating your online store. By doing this, you’ll be able to see how your store looks when changes are implemented and run tests before making any modifications to your live shop. You’ll be able to test version 1.6 and any themes and modules that you have installed. Setting up a test server will help you avoid any downtime and loss of sales.</p>
<p>This helpful article will take you step by step on <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/set-up-a-test-server-for-your-online-store/ " target="_blank">how to setup a test server for your online store</a>.</p>
<p><img style="border: 0pt none; float: left; padding-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/Checkmark.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #05a6bc;">Back up your online store</span></h4>
<p>In order to set up a testing environment for your online store you’ll need to back up your online shop. Some hosting providers automatically back up your online store; however, many developers strongly suggest manually backing up your shop, just in case something ever happens to your server. Also, keep in mind that your hosting provider may only back up your shop every week so you want to be sure that your testing environment has the latest version of your online store.</p>
<p>Learn more about <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/how-to-manually-back-up-mysql-database-and-prestashop-files/ " target="_blank">how to manually back up your PrestaShop store</a>.</p>
<p><img style="border: 0pt none; float: left; padding-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/Checkmark.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #05a6bc;">Theme compatibility</span></h4>
<p>Check to make sure that your theme is compatible with version 1.6. All 1.5 themes are compatible but some designs may differ a bit from the original theme due to the different module positions and the new two column theme in 1.6. This is why we strongly suggest testing your shop prior to making any live updates. Make sure to contact the developer of your theme to receive any updates. Also, if your theme is not Bootstrap compatible, it will still work on 1.6 but unfortunately, you will not be able to take advantage of the benefits of Bootstrap on mobile devices.</p>
<p><img style="border: 0pt none; float: left; padding-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/Checkmark.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #05a6bc;">Module compatibility</span></h4>
<p>Go through all the modules you have installed on your shop to see if they are compatible with 1.6 prior to upgrading. Great news! All PrestaShop developed modules are compatible with 1.6. You can also tell if your module is compatible with 1.6 simply by installing the module on your test environment and if no error appears then the module is compatible. If the module is not updated for 1.6 you can contact the developer of the module directly or contact an agency or freelancer to make the necessary changes to your module.</p>
<p>Read more about <a href="http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/1.6-specific+Developer+Documentation " target="_blank">module compatibility specific for PrestaShop 1.6</a>.</p>
<p><img style="border: 0pt none; float: left; padding-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/Checkmark.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #05a6bc;">Download the auto upgrade module</span></h4>
<p>As soon as PrestaShop 1.6 is released on March 17th 12:00PM EST, there will be an update for the <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/administration-tools-prestashop-modules/5496-1-click-upgrade-autoupgrade.html " target="_blank">1 Click Upgrade module</a>. This module provides an automated method to upgrade your shop to PrestaShop 1.6. Don’t forget back up your files and test the upgrade on a testing environment first!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="border: 0pt none; float: left; padding-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/Checkmark.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #05a6bc;">Test upgrade on test environment</span></h4>
<p>After completing all the steps above, you should start testing your online shop on the testing environment that you set up. Do a thorough test before updating your live store to avoid any down time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="border: 0pt none; float: left; padding-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/Checkmark.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #05a6bc;">Upgrade your online store</span></h4>
<p>If the upgrade went smoothly on your test store, now you’re officially ready to upgrade your live shop to PrestaShop 1.6! Just make sure that you have backed up your store with the latest version of your shop. After you updated your online store using the 1 Click Upgrade Module, you’ll have the option to restore the previous version. Do this if your theme or an essential (not native) module is not working properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="border: 0pt none; float: left; padding-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/Checkmark.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #05a6bc;">Test everything!</span></h4>
<p>You’re store is now running on PrestaShop 1.6! As you should have done when testing the upgrade on a testing environment, navigate throughout your entire site to make sure everything is working properly. You’ll want to go through every page, perform a test purchase and test your shop on different devices. If applicable run these test on the different languages you offer your customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The countdown for the release of the highly anticipated PrestaShop 1.6 has begun!  We want you to be fully prepared, so we gathered the questions that you asked us about 1.6 and our development team has addressed them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/EN_Answers-to-your-questions-about-1.61.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16166" title="EN_Answers to your questions about 1.6" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/EN_Answers-to-your-questions-about-1.61.jpg" alt="" width="595" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-16148"></span></p>
<h4><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Questions</span></strong></h4>
<p><strong></strong><strong><span style="color: #4f8c40;">1. I want to convince my clients to upgrade to 1.6 but they are hesitant about upgrade problems. How can I convince them that it will be safe?</span></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The main idea you want to tell your clients is that 1.6 has minimal changes to the files and database. This means that the core code between 1.5 and 1.6 is virtually the same. Upgrades from 1.5 to 1.6 are smooth. Follow the best practices of testing upgrades on a <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/set-up-a-test-server-for-your-online-store/">test environment</a> first and there is no need to be hesitant about upgrading to 1.6 first.</p>
<p><span style="color: #4f8c40;"><strong>2. What are the three main reasons why I should upgrade to 1.6?</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The awesome UI/UX improvements on Front and Back Office make managing your store easier than ever. We’ve included the best new technologies integrated in 1.6. You’ll be using the fastest and most flexible PrestaShop ever. The new real-time dashboard gives you the information you need to make smarter business decisions.<br />
-For more information, check out the <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/en/progress-1-6">Progress Page for 1.6</a></p>
<p><span style="color: #4f8c40;"><strong>3. Can you tell me more about the new technologies that are in v1.6?</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">a) <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a> – “Font Awesome gives you scalable vector icons that can instantly be customized — size, color, drop shadow, and anything that can be done with the power of CSS.”<br />
b)<a href="http://d3js.org/">Data Driven Documents</a> – “D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS.”<br />
c)<a href="http://compass-style.org/">Sass Compass</a> – “Compass is an open-source CSS Authoring Framework. It uses Sass to generate well formatted CSS and make your stylesheets easier to organize and maintain.<br />
d)<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> – “Bootstrap, a sleek, intuitive, and powerful mobile first front-end framework for faster and easier web development.”</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #4f8c40;">4. I want to improve the translation of PrestaShop in my language. How can I help?</span></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We are managing the translations of PrestaShop 1.6 with the Crowdin online collaborative translation platform. All you need to do is register on <a href="https://crowdin.net/">Crowdin.net</a> and <a href="https://crowdin.net/project/prestashop-official/">join our project</a>!</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #4f8c40;">5. I have a problem with 1.6 how can I get support?</span></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We have a number of different options for support. The community forum and Forge Issue tracker are great tools to use alongside our official support plans.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">a)<a href="http://www.prestashop.com/forums">Community Forum<br />
</a>b)<a href="http://forge.prestashop.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa">Forge Issue Tracker<br />
</a>c)<a href="https://www.prestashop.com/en/support">Support Plans </a></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #4f8c40;">6. Will you still support 1.5 after 1.6 is released? When do you plan on dropping support for 1.5?</span></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There will be no new releases of version 1.5. However, the 1.6 is running on the same core. You can still view the code and bug fixes published on <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop">GitHub</a>. Some weeks after the release of 1.6, it will no longer be possible to create issues for the 1.5 on the Forge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Upgrade Questions</span></strong></h4>
<p><strong><span style="color: #4f8c40;">1. What is the best way to upgrade to 1.6 if I am currently on 1.4 (or below)? Should I upgrade to 1.5 first or jump to 1.6?</span></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">No, the best way would be to upgrade directly to 1.6. Remember to test any upgrades before upgrading your live store.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #4f8c40;">2. How do I know if my upgrade will work?</span></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The recommended way to upgrade is to <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/set-up-a-test-server-for-your-online-store/">test the upgrade on a test environment</a>. Make sure to make a manual back-up of your live store.  <a href="http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS15/Updating+PrestaShop">Follow the Upgrade guide</a>. Never upgrade a live store without testing it first.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #4f8c40;">3. What if the auto-upgrade fails? Is there another way to upgrade?</span> </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong></strong>Officially, we do not support any other upgrade method. <a href="http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS15/Manual+update">Manual upgrades are deprecated and not recommended.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Compatibility Questions</span></strong></h4>
<p><span style="color: #4f8c40;"><strong>1. How can I tell if my theme and modules are compatible with 1.6?</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>a) <em>Modules:</em></strong> Contact the module creator to receive any updates. All PrestaShop developed modules are compatible. Simply by installing the module, if no error appears then the module is compatible + Addons compatibility. You should install modules on a testing environment instead of your live store.<br />
<strong>b)<em> Themes:</em></strong> All 1.5 themes are compatible with version 1.6, but some design may differ a little from the original. This is due to different modules positions and the new 1.6 two column theme. Contact the developer of the theme to receive any updates.</p>
<p><span style="color: #4f8c40;"> <strong>2. What if my theme is not Bootstrap compatible? Will that be an issue with 1.6?</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Even if your theme is not Bootstrap compatible, it will still work on 1.6. However, you will not take advantage of the benefits of Bootstrap on mobile devices. It should be fully compatible with any other template</p>
<p><span style="color: #4f8c40;"><strong>3. My favorite modules are not going to be updated for 1.6 compatibility, what should I do?</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You could contact the contributor to know the module compatibility roadmap. Otherwise you have the option of contacting an agency or freelancer to make the necessary changes to your module.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bugs and Issues</span></strong></h4>
<p><span style="color: #4f8c40;"><strong>1. How can I tell if a certain bug has been fixed in 1.6?</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Just search for the bug in the <a href="http://forge.prestashop.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa">Forge Issue Tracker</a> and check its status. The change-log also lists all the issues that have been fixed since the last release.</p>
<p><span style="color: #4f8c40;"><strong>2. What bugs have been fixed from 1.5?</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The change-log will give you all the necessary information.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #4f8c40;">3. Taxes have always been a huge problem for me, are they easier in 1.6?</span> </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong></strong>We are aware of the important work to be done on taxes in PrestaShop. Many patches will be made with 1.6 although much remains to be done. We expect a very important update on taxes in the coming months but we encourage you to migrate without waiting on 1.6 for now to enjoy the first corrections.</p>
<p><span style="color: #4f8c40;"><strong>4. I noticed some bugs and some missing features while testing 1.6, where do I report them to?</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Forge is the best place to report issues and missing features. You can also visit our Github page and changes to the 1.6 repository.</p>
<p><span style="color: #4f8c40;"><strong>5. Do you have a roadmap for adding new features to 1.6?</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A roadmap will be announced soon and updated regularly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is Bootstrap? If you own a website, you’ve probably seen the word “Bootstrap” while skimming through articles about web-design and development. You may have also overheard the word “Bootstrap” being tossed around by web-designers at coffee shops and bars around the world. These people know what Bootstrap is and the enormous benefits that it brings web-development world. But do you know why insisting on using the Bootstrap framework for your website is a smart choice?</p>
<p>In this 2 Part Series, I’ll go over the history of Bootstrap, what is Bootstrap exactly, along with several reasons why incorporating Bootstrap in your next website project is a great move.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/02/Bootstrap.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16071" title="Bootstrap" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/02/Bootstrap.png" alt="" width="554" height="257" /></a></p>
<h3><span id="more-16070"></span></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #4a772b;">History of Bootstrap</span></h3>
<p>In 2011, Bootstrap was created as an internal solution to solve developing inconsistencies within Twitter’s engineering team. Basically, there was no set code-structure in the way that engineers at Twitter chose to develop the platform.</p>
<p>Web-developing and web-engineering is a craft, many would say it’s an art, and each engineer has their own way of doing things. That works in some cases, but when there are multiple engineers working on the same project with slightly different coding approaches, inconsistencies are inevitable.  Inconsistencies in web-engineering can simmer and evolve into deep rooted coding issues that create uncertainty and increase maintenance time. Bootstrap was a tool originally developed by (now former) Twitter engineers Mark Otto and Jacob Thorton as an attempt to encourage Twitter’s engineering team to use the same framework to minimize those inconsistencies. Needless to say, the Bootstrap initiative succeeded at Twitter as the entire team worked faster, more efficiently and with fewer inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Although it started as an internal solution at Twitter, Mark and Jacob quickly realized that they were on to something much greater. In August of 2011, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2011/bootstrap-twitter">the Bootstrap framework was released</a> as an open-source project on Github. Within the next few months thousands of developers around the world contributed to the code and Bootstrap became the most active open-source development project in the world. Since then, Bootstrap has only gained in notoriety and has become “the most popular front-end framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/02/Boot.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16072" title="Boot" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/02/Boot.png" alt="" width="562" height="255" /></a></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #4a772b;">So…What the heck <em>is</em> Bootstrap?</span></h3>
<p>Put simply, Bootstrap is a collection of various, customizable web-design elements and functions all pre-packaged together in one tool. When designing a website with Bootstrap, developers can pick and choose which elements to use. More importantly, they can feel confident knowing that the elements they chose will not conflict with each other. It’s like having a puzzle, except that each puzzle-piece fits perfectly with the next, no matter what you choose.</p>
<p>These customizable elements contained within Bootstrap are a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  Thanks to the beauty of open-source, Bootstrap is constantly being improved. It has added a variety of awesome functions such as 100% total mobile responsiveness and feature-rich jQuery plugin selections.</p>
<p>In August of 2013, two years after the original release, <a href="http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2013/08/19/bootstrap-3-released/">Bootstrap 3 shipped out</a>. This latest version has a new design, better error handling, enhanced customization options and many more goodies that make developers jump for joy.<br />
<a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/02/prestashop_1-61.png"><img style="width: 275px; margin: auto; display: block; margin-left: 15px;" title="prestashop_1-6" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/02/prestashop_1-61.png" alt="" align="right" /></a><br />
It’s true that PrestaShop loves the Bootstrap framework. Our newest version, <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/en/progress-1-6">PrestaShop 1.6</a>, is developed completely with Bootstrap 3. A few months ago<a href="http://bit.ly/19WyODP">, Mark Otto shared his insights about PrestaShop, Bootstrap and the Ecommerce industry in this video</a>.</p>
<p>All of this translates to good news for developers and website owners alike. Stay tuned for Part 2 as I’ll answer the big question, why should you insist on a Bootstrap framework for your website?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that 39% of Americans celebrate <span style="color: #008000">St. Patrick’s Day</span>? Of those who do, <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/st-patricks-day/history-of-st-patricks-day/interactives/st-patricks-day-by-the-numbers" target="_blank">The History Channel</a> reports that Americans spend over $4.14 billion on this holiday.</p>
<p>With March 17th right around the corner, create your own luck by following these <strong><span style="color: #008000">7 St. Patrick’s Day marketing tips for E-commerce sales</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16125" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/7-St-Patricks-Day-Ecommerce-Marketing-Tips.jpg" alt="" width="531" height="352" /></p>
<p><span id="more-16124"></span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #008000">1. Use the Color Green, Sparingly</span></h4>
<p>Everyone, and I mean everyone, uses green to promote their St. Patrick’s Day Sale. Instead of plastering green everywhere, stay true to your brand’s look and feel. Customers should be able to recognize your brand through the ad. Take <a href="http://www.priceline.com/promo/deals/stpatricks/deals.html" target="_blank">Priceline’s St. Patrick’s Day Deal</a> page for example. They didn’t replace their blue with green nor did they replace the Priceline negotiator with a leprechaun. Simply use pops of green and a few holiday-related images to be festive.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16127" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/Priceline-St.-Patricks-Day.png" alt="" width="457" height="266" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #008000">2. Run Weekend Sales</span></h4>
<p>Although St. Patrick’s Day may not be a gift-giving holiday, you can still capitalize on the holiday spirit. Extend the sale dates to include the weekend leading up to the St. Patrick’s Day. This allows partygoers and parade attendees ample time to shop your sale. Conversely, if the holiday lands on a Friday, run the sale through the weekend.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #008000">3. Feature Anything St. Patrick’s Day Related</span></h4>
<p>The sky’s the limit. Start with green colored items. Next, try anything relevant to Ireland. If you sell soccer fan gear, offer special discounts for Irish Football Clubs such as Dublin City and Bohemians. If you sell desserts, feature products using Guinness as an ingredient or even Shamrock shaped goodies. Last but not least, use the lucky number 7. Offer $7 products or free shipping with a $77 purchase.</p>
<p>Take PrestaShop powered online shop, <a href="http://www.artoyz.com/" target="_blank">Artoyz</a>&#8216;s green product page, for example:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16126" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/Artoyz-St-Patricks-Day.png" alt="" width="501" height="373" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #008000">4. Create a Sense of Urgency &#8212; NOW</span></h4>
<p>You want customers to shop and you want them to shop now. Create a sense of urgency by giving them timed incentives. For example, “Be the first 10 shoppers to get an additional 7% off.” Or try a happy hour discount: “Shop before 4:00PM to get a (7*7*7)% discount, shop before 7:00PM to get a (7*7)% discount, or shop all weekend long for 7% off.” If you are a PrestaShop user, learn how to set up these St. Patrick’s Day discounts by visiting the <a href="http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS15/Creating+Price+Rules+and+Vouchers#CreatingPriceRulesandVouchers-CartRules" target="_blank">Pricing Rules and Vouchers</a> section of our Forum.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16129" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/St-Patricks-Day-Deal.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="270" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #008000">5. Let Customers Try their Luck</span></h4>
<p>Sticking with the St. Patrick’s theme, ask customers to try their luck. Recently popularized mystery boxes are a great way to do so. List a mystery box that offers a mix of products. If you’re unable to sell your products in this manner, you can still give customers some ‘luck’ by offering a surprise Gift with Purchase. In either case, be sure to outline the terms in your return policy.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #008000">6. Promote your Discounts</span></h4>
<p>Getting a discount is great news! Ask your current social media followers to help spread the word. If possible, incentivize them. Try the following: “Tag your luckiest friend for a chance to win a product!” Still not getting enough traffic? Send the details of your sale to relevant blogs. In exchange for giving the readers a special discount, you’ll get additional traffic to your online store.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-16128" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/RetailMeNot-St-Patricks-300x91.png" alt="" width="300" height="91" /></p>
<p>Have your sale ready to go? Submit your coupon to <a href="http://www.retailmenot.com/submit" target="_blank">RetailMeNot</a>!</p>
<h4><span style="color: #008000">7. Measure your Success</span></h4>
<p>Use different coupon codes for each campaign to measure its success. Try FBCLOVER for Facebook, IGLUCKY for instagram, and 17GOLD for e-mails. Unlike our previous tips, you won’t see the immediate benefits. However, by measuring each campaign’s success, you will know where to invest your time and money for future campaigns. You’ll see the benefits long after the excitement dies down.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-16130" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/St-Patricks-Day-Measure-Success-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
